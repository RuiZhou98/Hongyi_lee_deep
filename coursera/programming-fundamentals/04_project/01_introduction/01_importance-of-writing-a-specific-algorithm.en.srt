1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,275
You've learned a lot about thinking through algorithms with the seven steps,

2
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:10,050
the syntax and semantics of C and that

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,088
everything is a number principle and how it relates to types.

4
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:15,420
We're going to take a moment to underscore

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,680
the importance of being specific when you write an algorithm.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,160
Humans can usually figure out vague instructions because they have common sense.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,560
However, computers do not have common sense and only do exactly what you tell them to.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,115
When you write an algorithm,

9
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:32,580
you have to carefully think through exactly what to

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,805
do and be very specific as you write it down.

11
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:40,350
In the next course, we'll delve into turning your algorithm into code as well as

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,540
compiling and running the code and

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,550
testing the code to be more confident that it's correct,

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,040
then debugging it when something goes wrong.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,760
However, before we get there,

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,210
we're going to wrap up this course with you writing an algorithm in

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,670
English and having one of your fellow Coursera learners execute the algorithm.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,035
Of course you will also execute someone else's algorithm and peer review their work.

19
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:07,105
You want to be specific and clear when you do this so that

20
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:10,650
whoever executes your algorithm knows exactly what to do.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,590
To underscore the importance of being precise,

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,830
we're going to have a fun little demonstration of a vague algorithm.

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,800
Genevieve wrote me an algorithm to make a peanut butter and

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,010
jelly sandwich and I've forgotten all of my common sense.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,853
So, I'm only willing to do exactly what she said.

26
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,030
All right, Genevieve.

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,740
This is pretty basic.

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,330
I can't imagine what could go wrong.

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,794
Okay.

30
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:34,450
One, get out one piece of bread.

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,900
Okay, that seems hard to screw up.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,870
So far so good. Two, use a knife to put the peanut butter on it.

33
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,445
Okay.

34
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:48,565
This is trickier than you think.

35
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:52,820
I never knew that making a peanut butter sandwich was so difficult. All right.

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,310
Three, get out another piece of bread.

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,980
Okay.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,270
Four, use the knife to put the jelly on.

39
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,545
Okay, she didn't really tell me where to put the jelly on.

40
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:07,490
But I guess if someone told me to like put my clothes on they mean to wear them.

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,500
So, maybe she wants me to like wear that jelly. Yeah okay.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,770
Five, put the two pieces of bread together.

43
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,950
All right, do you want me to bite the sandwich?
