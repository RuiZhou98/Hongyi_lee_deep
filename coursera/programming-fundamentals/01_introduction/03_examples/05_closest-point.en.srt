00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,230
In this video, we're going to work the problem of finding

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,905
the closest point out of a set of points to some other given point.

3
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:13,060
We'll start by doing an instance of this problem by ourselves.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,920
To do that, I've begun by drawing

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,300
a Cartesian coordinate grid and choosing a set S of points,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,762
which you can see here,

7
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:25,325
another point P, which is one, negative one.

8
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,640
We're going to find the point in S that is closest to

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,660
P. The first thing I'm going to do is to draw my points on my Cartesian plane.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,950
Now, I can begin working through this.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,517
First, I need some domain knowledge.

12
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:45,577
I need the mathematical definition of the distance between two points,

13
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:46,850
which if you don't remember,

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,120
is the difference in the x values squared plus the difference in

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,245
the y values squared and then we take the square root of that.

16
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:59,230
So the way that I would do this is calculate the distance between P and two,

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,575
seven, and I would come up with 8.06.

18
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:07,670
Then, I would compute the distance between P and 10,

19
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,250
5 and come up with 10.82.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,760
The first point was closer,

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,105
so I'm going to keep that.

22
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:19,105
This point is 7.07 away,

23
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:22,460
so I'm going to keep the new closest point so far.

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,695
This point is 7.81 away,

25
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,785
so eight, negative two is still closer.

26
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:32,440
This point is 5.66 away,

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,160
so we have a new closest point.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,480
This point is 9.06 away,

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,615
so negative three, negative five is closer.

30
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:44,555
This point is 9.22 away,

31
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:48,500
so negative three, negative five is still closer.

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,800
And there are no more points to test, so negative three,

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,000
negative five is my answer to which point is closest to one, negative one.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,410
If we visually inspect this picture,

35
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,480
that seems pretty reasonable.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,740
It looks like the closest.

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,100
Now, I write down exactly what I just did.

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,892
I computed one squared plus eight squared,

39
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:16,915
took the square root and got about 8.06.

40
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:22,685
I computed the square root of nine squared plus six squared and got 10.82,

41
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:29,370
and I compared 10.82 to 8.06 and said 8.06 is smaller.

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,985
I computed the square root of seven squared plus negative one squared and got 7.07,

43
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:41,038
and I compared 7.07 to 8.06 and said 7.07 is smaller,

44
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,255
so this is a better choice.

45
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:50,195
Then I compared the square root of six squared plus negative five squared and got 7.81.

46
00:02:50,195 --> 00:03:00,745
I compared 7.81 with 7.07 and got that 7.07 was smaller and so on and so on and so on.

47
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:04,355
And then when I got to the end,

48
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:08,595
I gave my answer as negative three, negative five.

49
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,970
These seem like reasonable steps,

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,690
but we actually glossed over

51
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,990
something that we did in the process of writing these steps down.

52
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,090
It is very important that we write our steps down

53
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,265
carefully because if we're missing steps,

54
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:26,365
we're going to miss them when we go to generalize and end up having a problem.

55
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:28,410
Here's an important clue.

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,735
Look at this step where we give an answer of negative three, negative five.

57
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,060
When we go to generalize,

58
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,000
we're going to ask, "Why did we use negative three, negative five?"

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,420
Then we're going to notice we don't see negative three,

60
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,560
negative five anywhere else.

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,910
The fact that our answer seemingly comes out of

62
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,875
nowhere indicates that we're missing something.

63
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:55,340
We did some step without consciously thinking about it and writing it down,

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,895
and we need to fix that before we go on.

65
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:59,600
We may notice this now,

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,970
we may notice it when we go to generalize,

67
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,295
in which case we need to come back and fix it.

68
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,680
Why was it that we picked negative three,

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,780
negative five as our answer here?

70
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,240
Reviewing our last steps,

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,205
the last remaining dotted line of length 5.66 is what we were keeping track of,

72
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:19,490
our best choice so far.

73
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,235
We started at point two, seven,

74
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:26,540
then we went around and updated it each time we found a shorter distance.

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,535
However, as we wrote our steps,

76
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:33,680
we never mentioned the point that went with the shortest distance so far.

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,515
We should go back and fix our steps to include that.

78
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:40,115
We start with a best choice of two, seven.

79
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:44,840
When we got to eight, negative two and decided 7.07 was smaller,

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,095
we updated our closest point to eight, negative two.

81
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:49,590
When we got to negative three,

82
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,695
negative five and found that 5.66 was smaller,

83
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:56,360
we updated our best choice to negative three, negative five.

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,345
Now, this answer at the end makes sense.

85
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:03,040
It is whatever our best choice was last.

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,750
Now we're ready to generalize,

87
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,000
which we'll do in the next video.
