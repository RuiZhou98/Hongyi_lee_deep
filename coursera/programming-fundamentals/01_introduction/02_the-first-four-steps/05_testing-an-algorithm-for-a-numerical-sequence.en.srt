00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,375
In this video, we're going to test the algorithm that we just wrote.

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:11,720
We're going to be counting from zero to N and N as a variable.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,750
We're going to draw boxes for each of our variables to keep

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,590
track of what value they currently have as we step through our algorithm.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,620
As we begin, N has the value, five.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,580
The other thing we're going to keep track of is the output of our program.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,517
Here is a box labeled, output,

8
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:30,750
and every time we write something down,

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,235
we're going to write it into this output box.

10
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:38,150
Finally, we're going to use a green arrow to keep track of where we are.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,370
Right now, the arrow is right before the line that says count from zero to N,

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,415
which means we haven't done this yet. Now, we can start.

13
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,510
The first thing we want to do is count from zero to N inclusive,

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,555
and call each number that we're counting, i.

15
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,395
Since i is a variable,

16
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,560
and it's going to start with the value zero,

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,085
we create a box to hold i and its value of zero.

18
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:07,455
Now, we enter the next step.

19
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:12,370
The next thing we're going to do is write down N squared minus two times i.

20
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,910
We have a little bit of math to do here.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,475
N is the value, 5,

22
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,635
and i has the value, zero,

23
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:23,285
so this gives us 25 minus zero or 25.

24
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:26,435
And again, we're supposed to write this number down,

25
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:30,695
so we place this number into our output box.

26
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:36,480
Now, this process is going to repeat again and again.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,145
Now, i is going to have the value one.

28
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:43,190
Once again, we're going to compute N squared minus two times i.

29
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,450
This is the same as last time except i has the value of one.

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,110
This is 25 minus two or 23.

31
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,525
We write that to our output box.

32
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,535
Now, we just completed i equals zero,

33
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,915
and i equals one,

34
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:03,335
and we're trying to get all the way to i equals five.

35
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:06,330
So now, we're working on i with a value of two.

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,800
Once again, N squared minus two times i,

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,305
which is 25 minus four,

38
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:17,680
the value is 21, and we will write this to our output box.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,920
Now, we're working on i with the value of three.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,795
We're going to write down the number,

41
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:30,630
N squared minus two times i,

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,810
25 minus 6 which is 19,

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,320
into our output box.

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,298
And we're going to keep doing this.

45
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:46,520
For i having the value four, which is 17.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,290
For i equals five,

47
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:56,140
which is 15. i keeps getting larger each time we step through our algorithm.

48
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,180
When i equals 6, however,

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,020
we're going to stop because we're only counting up to N equals five.

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,665
At this point, we finished the entire algorithm,

51
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:10,540
and the good news is that our answer matches what we were expecting.

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,100
The sequence of numbers is,

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,000
in fact, what we were hoping to produce.
