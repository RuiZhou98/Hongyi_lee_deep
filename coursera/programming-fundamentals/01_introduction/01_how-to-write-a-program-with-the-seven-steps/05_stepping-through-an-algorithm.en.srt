1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,525
Let us briefly take a look at an example algorithm,

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:09,405
and how you might follow its steps yourself.

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,635
We don't need to know anything about programming to do these steps,

4
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:14,685
we just need to be able to do some math,

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:17,280
and keep careful track of what we're doing.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,670
This algorithm does not accomplish a really useful task,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,430
but gives us a simple example to start from.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,170
The algorithm says, "Given a non-negative integer N," so it is

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,495
parameterized over N. We need a value of N to actually do these steps,

10
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:36,380
so let's pick N equals two.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,040
We're also going to want a place to write down the output that the algorithm produces,

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,740
that is, everything that we are told to write down,

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,025
we will write in this output box.

14
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:49,320
We need to keep track of where we are,

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,390
so we are going to use this green arrow to remember what step we are currently on.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,130
We'll start at the start.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,480
The step right after the arrow says to make a variable called X,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,840
and set it equaled to N plus two.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,830
N is two, and two plus two is four,

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,925
so we want to note that X is initially four.

21
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,120
Our next step calls for us to count from zero to

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,885
N. We will want to give a name to the number we are counting,

23
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,750
so that we can use it in our other steps.

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,165
Here, we decided to call it i.

25
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,390
As we count, we are going to repeat steps.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,625
We've used indentation here to indicate

27
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,340
which steps are repeated for each number we count,

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,065
as well as explicitly noting in the step after that you do it,

29
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:36,075
when you finish counting.

30
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,785
We'll start with i being zero,

31
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:41,650
since that is the first number we said to count.

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,760
Our next step says to write down X times i.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,610
Four times zero is zero,

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,500
so we write down zero.

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,400
Our next step says for us to update the value of X.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,115
What is its new value?

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,120
Four plus zero times two is four,

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,870
so, we would update it to be four.

39
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,065
It's already four, which is fine,

40
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:06,300
we just keep its value as four.

41
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,620
Now, we have reached the end of the steps that we said to do as we count.

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,590
We need to go back and count the next number,

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,850
so we move our arrow back to the top of the step we were doing for each number,

44
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,825
and make i the next number we would count,

45
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,845
in this case, one.

46
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:27,180
Now, we begin doing these steps again with i having the value one.

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,580
What is X times i now?

48
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,795
Four times one is four,

49
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:34,860
so we write down the number four in our output.

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,175
Next, we are going to update X again, this time,

51
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:41,670
X plus i times N evaluates to six,

52
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,630
so we are going to change the value of X from four to six.

53
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,315
We've again reached the end of our repeated steps,

54
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:51,090
so we need to count our next number.

55
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,620
We'd go back to the top,

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,385
and then count our next value which is two,

57
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,845
and make that the value of i.

58
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,985
We said to count from zero to N,

59
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:02,965
and N is two, so are we done counting?

60
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:06,180
In these steps, we said to include both ends,

61
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,510
so we're going to do these steps when i has the value two.

62
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,290
So, we go in and do the repeated steps one more time.

63
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,620
Now, X times i has the value 12,

64
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,570
so we write down 12 in our output and we go to the next step.

65
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,640
Our next step says to update the value of X again,

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,535
evaluating X plus i times N,

67
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,215
we get 10 this time,

68
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,975
so we update the value of X to be 10,

69
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:33,615
and move past that step.

70
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:38,235
Once more, we've reached the end of the steps we want to repeat as we count,

71
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:41,365
so we return to the step where we said to count.

72
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:42,810
When we return here,

73
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,570
we look at our steps and realize that we've already

74
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,465
counted all of the numbers we were supposed to,

75
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:50,270
zero, one and two.

76
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,060
So, we're done counting.

77
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,390
Now, we want to go to the steps after we finish counting and do them.

78
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,670
This one says to write down the value of X. X currently has value 10,

79
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,810
so we write that in our output.

80
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,210
Now, our arrow is at the end of our steps.

81
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,255
There's nothing left to do, so we're done.

82
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:14,985
Zero, four, 12, 10 is the sequence of numbers that this algorithm wanted us to generate,

83
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:19,650
for N equals two which we see in our output box.
