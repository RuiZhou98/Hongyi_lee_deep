1
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:07,964
At this point, you've seen a lot of C
syntax and learned the semantics of it,

2
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,250
how to execute it by hand.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,521
So far, the only type you have
seen is int, as in int x = 3.

4
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,805
You're probably wondering about types and

5
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:22,950
what exactly int means, or for
that matter, what exactly a type is.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,630
In the upcoming lesson, you're going to
learn the answers to these questions and

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,610
many other things about types.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,340
All of this is going to build on one
key principle of computer science,

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,160
everything is a number.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,630
Computers can only operate on numbers, so

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,240
all data has to be
represented numerically.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,020
Types tell the computer how to interpret
and operate on the numeric representation.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,850
As you progress through this lesson,

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,830
you will learn about other
built-in types besides int.

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,700
You will also learn about implicit type
conversions and explicit type casting.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,350
As well as how to make your
own types to represent

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,950
whatever data you need to work with
