1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,620
My name is Ivy.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,040
I study at the Duke University
for the MEng program,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,740
aka Master of
Engineering program,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,770
and I'm studying Electrical
and Computer Engineering.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,100
Is a really awesome
experience to be

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,610
a student in this university
and in this program,

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,265
and I learn a lot here.

8
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:25,319
For some new programmer,

9
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:27,120
people may think
that programming is

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,550
totally magic but
actually is not.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,860
Everything is following the logic

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,335
and have to make sense in
the programming world.

13
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,570
So first, you need to trust

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,265
the logic rather than
just think random things.

15
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:42,925
Then also for the programming,

16
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,960
planning is something that you

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,270
have to really take
into consideration.

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,450
So rather than just put
some random things and

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,660
pretending you're working
in front of a screen,

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,610
and typing things
on the keyboard,

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,455
you actually need to
first make plans,

22
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:01,290
draw pictures, and seriously

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,600
think about what you need to do.

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,300
Then puts things implemented

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,435
actually in
the programming world.

26
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:13,285
Also, in Duke
University especially,

27
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,965
the professor and
all their courses is

28
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,920
very well planned and designed.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,290
So trust all the course project

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,005
you have to do and
do it step-by-step,

31
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:27,290
you'll finally be
a awesome programmer.

32
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,570
There's tons of project I've

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,880
finished in the whole program.

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,400
One thing I really
wanted to talk about is

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,770
the UPS and Amazon project.

36
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,680
I've done in the
server-less software class.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,570
So basically what's
happening is that

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,350
one team need to in-charge
of the UPS system,

39
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,420
and another team need to be in

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,235
charge of the Amazon system.

41
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,290
We need to design the protocol

42
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,845
altogether to make
everything work.

43
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:57,800
This project is very
special for me because it

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,355
actually mimics what is
happening in the industry life.

45
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,160
Because in industry
there's no way you can

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,280
finish your whole system by
yourself or even by one team.

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,630
So what is very

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,940
important is that you
need to learn how to

49
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,770
communicate with other team and

50
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,470
design their protocol altogether.

51
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,350
So during the whole
developing process,

52
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,545
we actually need to change
our protocol step-by-step,

53
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,705
and finally, get to
the perfect one.

54
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:27,300
The process is
a little bit of painful,

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,900
but finally we'll put
everything together and

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,960
find the whole system
work perfectly.

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:40,085
It's really good and inside
peaceful and happiness.

58
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:41,780
For those students who are

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,124
struggling in finding
a job or an interview,

60
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,335
I totally understand what
you're feeling right now.

61
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,790
I know it is hard,

62
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,565
but trust me you'll be flying.

63
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:56,510
I think for the most important
things about finding

64
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,500
a job is not about how can
I pass this interview,

65
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,800
but how can I be
a great software engineer.

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,070
To achieve that goal all
you need is to practice,

67
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,030
practice, and practice following
all the cross project,

68
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,260
and all the advice from all of

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,290
those professors because
they have their experience,

70
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,170
and they know what
the industry world need.

71
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,450
Once you get more
and more comfortable

72
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,435
to work as a software engineer,

73
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:26,130
the job will just come in to you.
