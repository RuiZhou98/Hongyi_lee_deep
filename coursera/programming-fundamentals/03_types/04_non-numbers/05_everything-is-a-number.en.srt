00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:07,406
You just read about how everything is
a number, but let's see how this principle

2
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:11,392
applies to some things that may not
seem like numbers at first glance.

3
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:12,906
Strings are numbers,

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:18,096
you have seen literal sequences of
characters before, such as Hello World!

5
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:21,680
But did you think about how
the computer stores them as numbers?

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,260
Each character occupies some
of the computer's memory.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,790
We'll talk about exactly how much later,
so

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,250
you can think of each character
conceptually in a box.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,320
In terms of hardware though, the computer
stores each character as a number.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,110
You can look up the decimal or hexadecimal
values of different characters in an ASCII

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,900
table, and you can see the decimal values
of these particular characters here.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,050
Of course, the computer stores
them as binary numbers.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,620
One fun consequence of computers
storing letters as numbers

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,270
is that we can do math on them.

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,250
This principle underlies most
modern methods of cryptography.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,780
Another thing that may not seem to
be a number at first is an image,

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,670
like this one of some flowers.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,410
This image is made of
about a million pixels,

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,310
which each numerically represent
the colors in the image.

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,970
To see these pixels, let's zoom in
on this small section of the image.

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,970
Here, you can see the image
magnified several times.

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,470
You can see how this image looks blocky or
pixelated.

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,660
This is what the image actually looks
like if you could look that closely.

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,390
Note that if you try this yourself,

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,540
you might end up with something
that looks much smoother like this.

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,440
Most image software will apply algorithms
to smooth out the pixelation when you

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,730
enlarge an image.

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,551
You have to turn that off
to see the original pixels.

29
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:46,140
Let us return to our enlarged image that
shows the original pixels more clearly.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,691
If we look only at a subset of this image,
and blow it up even further,

31
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:54,699
we can see and talk about
the individual pixels more easily.

32
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:58,688
Here are 16 pixels from the original
image, which had about a million pixels,

33
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:02,360
just to give you an idea of how
much we have zoomed in now.

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,140
This dark purple pixel has a red
value of 55, a green value of 27,

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,730
and a blue value of 75.

36
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,840
Meanwhile, this golden pixel has
drastically different RGB values,

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,450
166, 136, and 41,
giving it an entirely different color.

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,170
Sound is another important
thing that computers process.

39
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,520
As I'm talking, you can see
the waveforms of what I'm saying.

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,570
The computer encodes these as numbers and
sends them to the sound hardware,

41
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,970
which uses them to determine how to move
the speaker generating the desired sound.

42
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,590
There are many other types of data you
might want to represent and compute on.

43
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,380
You'll learn about data that is
formed from sequences in Course 3.

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,235
For now, you're going to learn
about structs and typedefs.
