1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,220
Now, let's see how to execute code with conditional statements in it.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,080
Here, we have a function f which has some if and if else statements.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,395
As always, our program starts its execution at the beginning of main.

4
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:19,225
The first statement declares a variable a,

5
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:21,800
so we make a box for it.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,008
Even though this statement initializes a,

7
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,565
it's going to take us several steps to compute that value,

8
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:30,635
so we're going to leave a's value as a question mark

9
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:34,745
until we compute the value of f of 3, 4.

10
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:36,980
To evaluate the call to f,

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,085
we make a frame passing the values of the parameters.

12
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:46,940
We know where to return to and move the execution arrow to the first line of f.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,650
The next line of code is an if statement whose conditional expression is x less than y.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,524
We evaluate that expression and find that three less than four is true,

15
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:01,010
so we move the execution arrow into

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,270
the then clause of this if statement and continue executing.

17
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,775
The next statement is a call to print f,

18
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,990
which you are familiar with.

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,040
We write x less than y in our output.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,215
Next, we return y plus x.

21
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:20,180
This follows the same rules you have already learned for return statements.

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,795
We evaluate the expression to get the return value which is seven.

23
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:27,575
This is what the function call will evaluate to.

24
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:29,638
And now, we return back to the caller,

25
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:33,180
destroying the frame for f. Now,

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,880
we are ready to finish initializing a since we know that

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,090
the call of f evaluated to seven.

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,330
So a is now seven.

29
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,390
We are now ready for the next line of code in main.

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,470
We make a box for b and call f,

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,480
passing in seven and five.

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,215
We once again want to evaluate the condition,

33
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,255
x less than y.

34
00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:01,050
However, now, x is seven and y is five,

35
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,380
so x less than five is false.

36
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,450
We find the close curly brace for

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,385
this if statement and see that the if statement has an else clause.

38
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:14,160
So we move the execution arrow into the start of

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,150
the else clause and continue executing from there.

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,135
First, we execute the print statement,

41
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:24,480
and then we reach another if statement.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,285
This if statement is nested inside of the else,

43
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,765
but that does not affect the rules of how we evaluate it.

44
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:33,405
We see that the conditional expression is false,

45
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:37,770
so we look for the close curly brace of the if statement.

46
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,635
There is no else clause,

47
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,440
so we move the execution arrow immediately past

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,160
the close curly brace and continue execution.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,875
There are no more statements inside the else clause,

50
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:54,050
so we move the execution arrow outside of the else clause and keep going.

51
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,730
Now, we have a return statement so we evaluate the expression, x minus two,

52
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,130
to find that the return value is five,

53
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,495
which will get returned to the place that we have noted.

54
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:07,558
We return back to the main and destroy the frame for f,

55
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:11,000
then we finish the assignment statement.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,858
Now, we are at the return statement from main,

57
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:17,000
we execute that, and exit the program.
