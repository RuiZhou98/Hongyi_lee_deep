  So far, we have discussed reading code in terms of step-by-step execution to determine its effects. While this skill is crucial for programmers, another useful skill is to be able to understand the meaning of a piece of code—what algorithm it implements and how it does so. This skill is useful to programmers, as they may need to understand—and possibly modify—code that they did not write.

  The skill of reading code and ascertaining its higher level meaning is, in some ways more of a matter of reversing the process of writing code—you translate the code into the algorithmic steps it represents, then figure out what the purpose of that general algorithm is. Sometimes you accomplish this by working examples from the algorithm to see what it does. Sometimes the original programmer was helpful and wrote documentation explaining what it does and how it accomplishes that task.
