00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,460
In this example, you're going to learn how to

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,305
execute code with a continue statement in it.

3
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:12,880
Here, we have a for loop that has a continue statement inside.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,390
With a for loop, when you execute a continue statement,

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,495
the loop increment is performed with the continue.

6
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:24,835
To see this, let us first convert this for loop to the equivalent while loop.

7
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:28,000
Here, we've taken one step in the conversion process,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,700
moving the variable declaration before the loop.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,860
To move this closer to being a while loop,

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,860
we've moved the increment statement i++ to the end of the loop.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,330
But notice that we also put i++ right before the continue statement.

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,035
Now, we've finished changing this for loop to an equivalent while loop.

13
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:50,425
Since i will go out of scope at the end of the function anyways,

14
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,780
we can get rid of the extra curly braces that we

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,770
wrote here without changing our code's behavior.

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,220
Now we are ready to begin executing.

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,830
We begin by calling our printRemainders function,

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,246
passing in negative two,

19
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:07,060
four and five as parameters.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,180
We then declare i and initialize it to lo and reach our while loop.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,150
i less than high is true,

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,030
so we enter the while loop.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,280
i equals zero is false,

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,735
so we skip past the if statement and print five mod negative two is one.

25
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:29,075
We increment i and now have reached the end of the while loop.

26
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:33,260
So, we go back to the top of the loop.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,225
i less than hi is true,

28
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,900
so we enter the loop body.

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,310
Again, i is not zero,

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,905
so we skip the if statement and print out five mod negative one is zero.

31
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:49,330
We increment i and then return to the top of the loop.

32
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,455
i less than hi is still true,

33
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:55,110
so we go inside the loop body.

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,060
However, now i is zero,

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,445
so we entered the then clause of this if statement.

36
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,655
We print that we cannot divide by zero.

37
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:07,870
Increment i and now reach the continue statement.

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,680
The continue statement just takes us to the start of the loop again,

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,230
right before we check the loop condition,

40
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,030
so we move the execution arrow back here.

41
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,660
Now we just do the next loop iteration as you would expect.

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,880
Since i is one not zero,

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,355
printing out a message and incrementing i.

44
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,973
We do the loop again with i being two,

45
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,600
printing out that five mod two is one,

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,330
and finally, one more time,

47
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,340
through the loop with i being three.

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,620
After this last iteration,

49
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,920
i less than hi is false,

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,270
so we skip the body of the while loop and return from printRemainders.

51
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,490
Now, we return from main, exiting the program.
